# react-viewport-playground

Playground for writing algorithms to determine whether DOM elements are inside viewport with respect to different requirements. E.g., is an element 40% vertically visible?

## Things I wanted to learn

With this project I want to learn or improve the following things:

- Improve my React skills in general
- What are [Refs](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) and how to use them
- How to use scroll events in React
- How to determine whether an element is inside the viewport
- How to use low-level DOM API (e.g., [Element.getBoundingClientRect()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect)) in React
- Improve my testing skills with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library)
